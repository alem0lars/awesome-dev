# C

## Strings

- [`sds`](https://github.com/antirez/sds): Simple dynamic strings library for C.

## Networking

- [`czmq`](https://github.com/zeromq/czmq): High-level C binding for Ã˜MQ.

## Unit testing

- [`cunit`](http://cunit.sourceforge.net): Automated testing framework.

## Formatting tools

- [`uncrustify`](https://github.com/bengardner/uncrustify): Highly configurable C code formatter.

## Documentation tools

- [`global`](https://www.gnu.org/software/global): Source code tagging system that works the same way across diverse environments.

## Analysis tools

### Static

- [`splint`](http://www.splint.org): Tool for statically checking C programs for security vulnerabilities and coding mistakes. With minimal effort, Splint can be used as a better lint. If additional effort is invested adding annotations to programs, Splint can perform stronger checking than can be done by any standard lint.
- [`complexity`](http://www.gnu.org/software/complexity/manual): Tool designed for analyzing the complexity of C program functions.

### Dynamic

- [`strace`](http://sourceforge.net/projects/strace): A system call tracer, i.e. a debugging tool which prints out
a trace of all the system calls made by a another process/program.
- [`valgrind`](http://valgrind.org): Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your programs in detail. You can also use Valgrind to build new tools.

## Debugging

- [`gdb`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb): The GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on `inside' another program while it executes or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed.
