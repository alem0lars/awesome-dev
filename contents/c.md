# C

## Unit testing

- [`cunit`](http://cunit.sourceforge.net): Automated testing framework.

## Analysis tools

- [`splint`](http://www.splint.org): Tool for statically checking C programs for security vulnerabilities and coding mistakes. With minimal effort, Splint can be used as a better lint. If additional effort is invested adding annotations to programs, Splint can perform stronger checking than can be done by any standard lint.

## Debugging tools

- [`strace`](http://sourceforge.net/projects/strace): A system call tracer, i.e. a debugging tool which prints out
a trace of all the system calls made by a another process/program.
