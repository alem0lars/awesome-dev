# C

## Unit testing

- [`cunit`](http://cunit.sourceforge.net): Automated testing framework.

## Formatting tools

- [`uncrustify`](https://github.com/bengardner/uncrustify): Highly configurable C code formatter.

## Analysis tools

### Static

- [`splint`](http://www.splint.org): Tool for statically checking C programs for security vulnerabilities and coding mistakes. With minimal effort, Splint can be used as a better lint. If additional effort is invested adding annotations to programs, Splint can perform stronger checking than can be done by any standard lint.

### Dynamic

- [`strace`](http://sourceforge.net/projects/strace): A system call tracer, i.e. a debugging tool which prints out
a trace of all the system calls made by a another process/program.
- [`valgrind`](http://valgrind.org): Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. There are Valgrind tools that can automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs, and profile your programs in detail. You can also use Valgrind to build new tools.
