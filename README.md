# Awesome development

Awesome libraries, frameworks for software development.

Today a lot of `awesome-*` repositories exist, but they are really fat. I want to collect the list of the *best* libraries out there for every specific task I'm involved on.

I don't care to provide different alternatives for a single task, I just show you what I think is the best.
