# Awesome development

Awesome libraries, frameworks for software development.

**Today a lot of `awesome-*` repositories exist, but they are really fat. I want to collect an opinated list of the _best_ libraries out there for every specific development task, programming language I'm involved on.**

The difference here is that **I don't care to provide different alternatives, I just show you what I think is the best, ending up with small and minimal lists**.
